# DataFrame Definitions
# Glenn Abastillas
# November 25, 2019
# 
# This configuration file contains the definitions of data used in the creation
# of the Board Report. This information is used by the `query` method in the
# database package. There are two types of DataFrame definitions: the (1) Base
# type and the (2) Subset type.
#
# Base Type: This data is retrieved from a SQL query to a database, which
# results in a DataFrame. This can be used alone or subset.
#       Format:
#           name:   # Name of DataFrame
#           query:  # Reference to the query in configuration.yml
#
# Subset Type: This data is derived from Base data pulled from a SQL database.
#       Format:
#           name:           # Name of DataFrame
#           parent:         # Name of Base DataFrame to subset
#           conditions:     # Conditions to subset Base data as a tuple
#
